# Obsidian Kanban Dashboard Configuration
#
# This file works out of the box with the bundled mock vault.
# To connect your own Obsidian vault, either:
#   1. Edit VAULT_PATH below directly, or
#   2. Copy this file to .env and edit that (keeps your config git-ignored)
#
# A .env file, if present, takes priority over this file.

# Path to your Obsidian vault's daily notes folder
# Change this to your vault path, e.g.:
#   /Users/yourname/Documents/My Vault/Daily Notes
#   /home/yourname/obsidian-vault/Daily Notes
#   C:/Users/yourname/Documents/My Vault/Daily Notes
VAULT_PATH=./mock-vault/Daily Note

# Server port for the API backend
